# 🧑 About Me

I am a senior at [Ocean University of China](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/), where I will graduate in 2026 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences. During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of being guided by [Xueying Zeng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xueying-Zeng) and [Yueming Lv](https://yueming6568.github.io/).
